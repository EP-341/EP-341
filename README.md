# EP-341: Programming in Max

This repository hosts sample codes used in [EP-341: Programming in Max](https://college.berklee.edu/courses/ep-341), a class on learning the basic programming concepts of [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max). EP-341 is a course at [Berklee College of Music](https://www.berklee.edu/) in the [Electronic Production and Design](https://college.berklee.edu/electronic-production-design) department. Sample codes are provided as a resource for learning Max, and they are used in EP-341 taught by [Akito van Troyer](https://vantroyer.com/). 

The repository is organized following the week-by-week schedule for the course. The first half interfacing Max with MIDI controllers and learning to sequence music. The second half focuses on audio programming in Max.
